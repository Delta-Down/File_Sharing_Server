Code for a file sharing server that ran for a few years before I forgot the LUKS password and lost all of the files ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Main.php contains code for file upload, routing, and thumbnail generation, as well as some frontend formatting. This was a learning project and was my intro to web design.

Additional HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL files are floating around somewhere and *might* be recovered at some point
